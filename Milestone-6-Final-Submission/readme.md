	- Challenges that we faced during this project, and the lessons learnt for the future thereby
	
	- The next steps beyond the project submission - how our existing application can be improved further
	
	- A section describing code review, issue reporting and tracking using screenshots

- The final video workflow demonstration for our ticketing system application. In this video, we get into a Google Meet and make a presentation about our application. We also demonstrate some specific workflows involving the frontend and the backend REST API.

- A PDF version of the presentation used in the final workflow demonstration video. This presentation basically summarizes our project as a whole.

- Two separate video files for the frontend and backend workflow demonstrations, under the "Workflow Demonstration Videos" folder. These videos have been merged into the final presentation video submitted.


**This project has been a greatly enriching learning experience**. It has been more about the journey and the experiences gathered thereof, rather than the destination itself. Having reliable and trustworthy teammates who have our back was just cherry on the top. 

**On behalf of Team Synergy_4APD, this is Preetodeep signing off. Onward!** :)
